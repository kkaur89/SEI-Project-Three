## Project Overview
This was a group project, with a brief to create a MERN stack app with a topic of our own choosing, where we were also able to create our own APIs. The concept for our app was driven by our common love for travelling. Iceland came up as one of the must see places to visit, so we thought this would be a great place to base our app around. The aim of the site is for future users to explore self-driving tours packages available in Iceland. The user would be able to read up on daily itineraries and explore on a map of the locations they can visit (hotels, restaurants, attractions).
