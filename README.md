## Project Overview
This was a group project, with a brief to create a MERN stack app with a topic of our own choosing.
The concept for our app was driven by our common love for travelling. Iceland came up as one of the must see places to visit, so we thought this would be a great country to base our app around. The aim of the site is for users to explore self-driving tours available in Iceland. The user would be able to read up on daily itineraries for each package and explore on a map all of the locations they can visit (hotels, restaurants, attractions).

Once registered and logged in the user can rate a place on the map, and also save locations to their profile page.
