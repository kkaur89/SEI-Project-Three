## Project Overview
This was a group project, with a brief to create a MERN stack app with a topic of our own choosing.
The concept for our app was driven by our common love for travelling. Iceland came up as one of the must see places to visit, so we thought this would be a great country to base our app around. The aim of the site is for users to explore self-driving tours available in Iceland. The user would be able to read up on daily itineraries for each package and explore on a map all of the locations they can visit (hotels, restaurants, attractions).

Once registered and logged in the user can rate a place on the map, and also save locations to their profile page.

Explore the full site **[here](https://icelander.netlify.app)**. You will need to a log in to explore all features, feel free to use the below:

## Project Timeline - 9 days

### Day One - Planning

The first day was spent on planning the project. We created a google doc, outlining a plan for the key areas of focus:

- MVP - What are the basic features we want the user to be able to access?
- Components that we would then need in the front end to support these features, and how would they link to each other.
- Building the API - all the endpoints we would need, and what the dataset would look like for each endpoint.
- The models in the backend and the relationships between them.
- Packages that we would need to support our app.

The next step was to create a wireframe based on the MVP features we landed on. We used Excalidraw for the first time, this app was perfect for allowing us all to be collaborative and evryone to be ale to see live how the site would look.

Once we were signed off, we then got together and created a Trello board for the project outline all the tasks needed to achieve MVP and also added additonal feautres if we had time.
